(programmable coolant subroutine for aiming the coolant nozzle)
(settings for setup are located on probe basic setting page)
(in the programmable coolant constants container.)
(calculations assume coolant nozzle is on axis b and has been homed)
(to 0 degrees rotation aiming perpendicular to the spindle center line)
(coolant nozzle is located on the right side of the spindle head and)
(rotates counter clockwise from home position with commands)
